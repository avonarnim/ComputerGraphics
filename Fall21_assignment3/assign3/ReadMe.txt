1) Ray tracing triangles                  yes
   This can be seen in still image 002.jpg. There, three triangles are rendered.
   The two triangles overlap, showing that the code displays the foremost object's pixel.

2) Ray tracing sphere                     yes
   This can be seen in still image 000.jpg. There, ten spheres are rendered with elongation based on perspective.
   This can also be seen in still image 001.jpg, which shows overlapping spheres.

3) Triangle Phong Shading                 yes
   This can be seen in still image 002.jpg -- different triangles have different lighter areas based on the location of lights in 002.txt.

4) Sphere Phong Shading                   yes
   This can be seen in still image 000.jpg and 001.jpg. 000.jpg shows different shininess and diffuse lighting based on different lighting coefficients.

5) Shadows rays                           yes
   Shadows can be seen in 001.jpg, where a light is placed on the far right and causes shadows to appear on spheres on large sphere's left side

6) Still images                           yes
